Then, hit `run` and see what errors occur. Fix the errors and press `run` again until you are error free. Click on the `ðŸ‘€ Answer` to compare your code to the correct code.*

## Headers Up!

ðŸ‘‰ What's the problem here?


```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
  username = request.header["X-Replit-User-Name"]
  return f"Hello {username}"

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=81)
```

This is a mistake I make **all** the time, it's `headers` not `header`. This will throw an 'Internal Server Error'.

```python
  username = request.headers["X-Replit-User-Name"]
```
